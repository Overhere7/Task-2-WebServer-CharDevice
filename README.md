Network File Server and Linux Character Device Driver
This repository contains two projects:

Network File Server: A Python-based web server that allows file uploads and downloads over the internet.
Linux Character Device Driver: A Linux kernel module that implements a basic character device driver for read and write operations.
Project 1: Network File Server
Overview
This project sets up a web server with Python's Flask framework, enabling file uploads and downloads. By using ngrok, the server becomes accessible over the internet, even outside your local network.

Key Steps
Install Flask: Flask provides the web framework for handling HTTP requests.

bash
Copy code
pip install flask
Write the Server Code:

file_server.py hosts an interface for uploading files and accessing them via generated URLs.
An HTML template provides a basic form to upload files from the browser.
Expose the Server with ngrok:

Run ngrok http 5000 in a terminal to create a public URL linked to your local server.
This allows you to share the server link for file access and uploads from anywhere in the world.
Important Considerations
Security: Ensure the server is configured securely, especially if deployed permanently.
File Management: Uploaded files are saved in a local directory; you may want to add automatic file cleanup if needed.
Project 2: Linux Character Device Driver
Overview
A character device driver provides low-level access to a Linux device, allowing user-space applications to perform read and write operations on a simulated device. This project includes a simple Linux kernel module (char_device.c) with basic open, read, write, and close functionalities.

Key Steps
Create the Character Device Source Code:

char_device.c implements file operations such as open, read, write, and release.
Use Linux kernel headers like <linux/module.h>, <linux/fs.h>, and <linux/uaccess.h> for interfacing with kernel functions.
Create a Makefile for Module Compilation:

The Makefile automates the module compilation and cleanup.
Ensure that kernel headers are installed to avoid compilation errors.
Compile and Load the Module:

bash
Copy code
make
sudo insmod char_device.ko
Register the device with a unique major number and create a /dev entry for access.
Use mknod to set up a device node.
Test the Device with User-space Application:

A user-space program opens the device file, writes data, and reads it back to confirm the moduleâ€™s functionality.
Important Concepts
Kernel Modules: Drivers run in kernel space, and interactions with user-space require careful handling for safety.
Character Devices: Character devices provide unbuffered, direct access to hardware or simulated data streams.
Key Commands
Exposing the Server with ngrok
bash
Copy code
ngrok http 5000
Building and Running the Character Device Driver
bash
Copy code
make           # Compile the module
sudo insmod char_device.ko  # Insert the module into the kernel
sudo mknod /dev/char_device c <major_number> 0  # Create device node
Removing the Module
bash
Copy code
sudo rmmod char_device  # Remove the kernel module
make clean              # Clean up compiled files
